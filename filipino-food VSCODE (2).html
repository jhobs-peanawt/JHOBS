            1. ) It's the Filipino dish everybody knows
            <br>
            the mighty adobo. It is made by stewing meat
            <br> 
            (usually chicken, pork, or a combination of both) in soy sauce and vinegar,
            <br>
            adding peppercorns and bay leaves for that special flavour.
            <br> 
            Bonus leftovers tip: pull the meat from the bone and fry 'til crispy
            <br> 
            for some tasty adobo flakes.

            customarily, oxtail, but other meatier cuts of beef can also be added in. 
            <br>

            a scrumptious crispy pata is an equally sinful alternative.
            <br> 
            It's a dish that takes the entire pig leg and deep fries it to perfection. 
            <br>

            6.) Served sizzling on a hot stone plate, sisig is a favorite pulutan (beer chow) among Filipinos.

            The meat is primarily chopped up parts of the pigs' face ' in the Philippines, 
            <br>
            no cut of the animal goes to waste. Some recipes use either mayonnaise or raw egg (to be mixed in while hot)
            <br>
            to give it a creamier texture but the classic way is to incorporate pig's brain into the dish.

            <br>
            (due to its customary presence in Filipino birthday parties) is pancit (noodles), 
            <br>
            of which pancit guisado is perhaps the most well-known variant. 
            <br>
            This noodle dish is served as a symbol for long life, hence an essential at birthday feasts. 
            <br>
            The saut'ed noodles are complemented by sliced vegetables and meat (all cooked in broth, soy sauce,
            <br> 
            and fish sauce) and kalamansi is squeezed over upon serving.

            9.) A merienda (snack in between meals) favourite in the Philippines is Pinoy pork barbecue. 
            <br>
            While this skewered sweet meat goes wonderfully well with the ubiquitous plain rice during meals,
            <br> 
            there's also nothing like catching yourself hungry in the middle of the afternoon and conveniently walking down the street over to the vendors grilling them road-side
             <br>
            for only PHP15 ($0.30) a stick.

            10.) Vibrantly orange and jam-packed with different textures and flavours, palabok is another well-loved way of cooking pancit. 
            <br>
            It is mixed in with a shrimp sauce, which gets its recognisable colour from annatto powder. 
            <br>
            It is finished off with a variety of toppings such as slices of hard-boiled eggs, crushed chicharon (pork rinds), tinapa (smoked fish) flakes, and spring onions.
